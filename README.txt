READ THIS BEFORE USE OF APPLICATION!!

Run AdminSystem.exe to run the application. From there you get a login screen.
The username and password for admin is "admin" "adminpass"
Each page has its own page, except main since it does not have information you can change. It also has the ability to delete and add users that can login to the page.

Since the admin file has a exe extension, it will be problematic to use it on mac. If you are going to use mac
then you have options like "boot strap" which can help you open the exe file. Otherwise you are going to have to use
the python file that is added. You need an IDE and the package mysql.connector. This can be done by the instructions on this 
site: https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/ or by writing the code "pip install mysql-connector-python" to the CMD.


WEBSITE

The website has a domain that is administrated by us. If you wish to have this website online after the project, you have to pay a annual sum to keep the domain name. If you wish to switch to a new domain, you can purchase it, but then you need to do another procedure of administrating the database, and change the config and php files.

You can start the website from both the application and by link #LINKLIFEWSOFVLEFJEROISFJCMOIEWDSLFJC MEWODISLFMPWDFJDPFJEWPO
